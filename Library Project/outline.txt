create a library to store books

each book can have several attirbutes, such as:     (first draft, changes and improvements expected)
    title
    author (s) ; no restriction on the number of authors
    publisher
    price
    copies ; this will hold the total number of copies of that book in the library 
    isbn code ; implement proper case checking

features:   (first draft, changes and improvements expected)
    implement a method to search for a book in the library, according to its isbn or title
    in this case, also implement a method for displaying the info for a book
    implement a method for lending a book
        keep track of the books lended by the user and correctly modify the copies of that book in the library
        after lending, show modified amount of copies of that book
        after lending, show the user all the books that they have lended
    all other features include getters and setters
    the setters will be used for modifying any data member for any book (object)

    if the copies of a book reach zero, that book gets removed from the library

main idea:      (first draft, changes and improvements expected)
    have the user in an endless loop menu, presenting him choices to perform
    the choices will include: 
        add a book to the library
        search for a book in the library
        lend a book from the library
        see total number of books available in the library
        see all the current books lended by the user ; to be done in the main function
        exit the program
